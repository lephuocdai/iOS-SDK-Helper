/** 
 * \brief This is the main View Controller. Deals with the connection parameters and call start.
 * The MainViewController is a WeemoDelegate. As such, it is responsible for the WeemoDriver connecting to the WeemoCloud and for user authentication. Any error sent by the Weemo singleton is dealt with here.
 *
 * On Application start, the Weemo singleton is instanciated automatically with a preset URLReferer found in the project pch. When the delegate is notified of the connection success, the Authenticate button and the YourID textfield are activated, allowing a user to authenticate oneself on the cloud.
 *
 * After authentication, the Call button and ContactID textfield are activated, allowing the user to call another contact.
 *
 * Three labels display information about the current session. 
 *		The first display the username (which is here equivalent to the UserID, for no special reason) followed by "| SIPOK" if the user can call. If the user can not call, the suffix is "| SIPNOK".
 *		The second display the status of the ongoing call or <No call> if no call is currently ongoing.
 *		The third field displays the debugInformation of the last encountered error.
